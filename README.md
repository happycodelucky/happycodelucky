### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Paul! I keep myself sane by working/maintainging a few side projects. There's some things I'm not ready to share here yet, or are in a state of flux. I'd love to spend more time on public repositories and sharing support for the community, unfortunately I've become quite a bit busier in the last couple of years. I'll try get to feature requests and issues, just be a bit patient so I can catch up ðŸ™‚. 

Thanks for stopping by!
